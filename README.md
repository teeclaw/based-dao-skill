# BASED DAO Auction Skill

OpenClaw skill for bidding on BASED DAO NFT auctions on Base network.

## Overview

BASED DAO is a Nouns-style DAO on Base that auctions one governance NFT every 24 hours. This skill enables AI agents to check auction status and place bids programmatically.

## Installation

### For OpenClaw

1. Clone or download this skill to your OpenClaw skills directory
2. Install dependencies: `npm install ethers`
3. The skill will automatically load when needed

### For Other Frameworks

Copy the scripts and reference files to your project and use them directly with Node.js.

## Features

- ✅ Check current auction status
- ✅ Place bids with full validation
- ✅ View governance proposals
- ✅ Vote on proposals (requires NFT ownership)
- ✅ **Telegram inline buttons** - Interactive control panel with persistent buttons
- ✅ Safety checks and clear error messages

## Telegram Control Panel (NEW!)

For OpenClaw users with Telegram integration, you can control BASED DAO auctions via an interactive button panel.

### Quick Start

Say **"based dao"** to your agent, and it will send an interactive control panel with buttons:

- 📊 **Check Auction** - Get current auction status
- 💰 **Quick Bid 0.001Ξ** - Place a bid instantly
- 📋 **Active Proposals** - View active governance proposals
- 🗳️ **All Proposals** - View all proposals (including past)
- 🔄 **Refresh Panel** - Update the panel with latest data

**Requirements:**
- OpenClaw with Telegram channel enabled
- `channels.telegram.capabilities.inlineButtons` set to `"all"` or `"allowlist"`
- Bot token configured in OpenClaw config

### How It Works

1. **Panel Display**: `send-panel.js` sends a message with `InlineKeyboardMarkup` via Telegram Bot API
2. **Button Callbacks**: When clicked, buttons send commands like `/based_check` back to the agent
3. **Command Routing**: `handle-command.js` processes the callback and runs the appropriate script
4. **Persistent**: Buttons remain functional until the message is deleted

### Manual Panel Send

```bash
node scripts/send-panel.js <chat_id>
```

This bypasses OpenClaw's message tool and sends buttons directly via Telegram Bot API.

## Usage

## Key Addresses

- **Token Contract**: `0x10a5676ec8ae3d6b1f36a6f1a1526136ba7938bf`
- **Auction House**: `0x0D2790f4831bDFd6a8Fd21C6f591bB69496b5e91`
- **Governor**: `0x1b20dcfdf520176cfab22888f07ea3419d15779d`
- **Network**: Base (Chain ID: 8453)
- **RPC**: `https://mainnet.base.org`

## How It Works

### Auctions

1. **24-hour auctions** - New auction starts immediately after previous settles
2. **Reserve price** - First bid must meet reserve (~0.0008 ETH)
3. **Bid increments** - Each bid must be 10% higher than previous
4. **Time extension** - Bids in last 15 minutes extend auction by 10 minutes
5. **Refunds** - Previous bidder automatically refunded when outbid

### Governance

1. **1 NFT = 1 vote** - Each BASED DAO NFT gives you one vote
2. **Proposal threshold** - Need 4 NFTs to create proposals
3. **Voting delay** - 1 day after proposal creation before voting starts
4. **Voting period** - 4 days to cast votes
5. **Delegation** - Must delegate your NFTs to vote (usually to yourself)
